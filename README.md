## Purpose, tools and Languages

This is a simple task manager app where users are able to create, delete and update a task. It won't allow you to create an empty task. It was developed using vanilla javascript, Bootstrap and sweetalert2 for the styles.
The app also connects with the jsonplaceholder's API "/todos", a free and fake API available for tests which allowed me to implement the CRUD operations (Create/Post Method, Read/Get Method, Update/Put Method and Delete/Delete Method) in my app, meaning that when you run the code, the first thing you'll see is a list of tasks defined by the API used and by the GET method.

As I'm working in the development of my portfolio, this is my first created app. I choosed to make a to dos app beacuse i think it is a simple way of showing my skills and understanding of html, css, bootstrap, RESTful APIs and vanilla javascript.

## Instructions

The app only contains three files, one html, one css and one javascript, so it is relly simple to make it run. You just have to download the files and make sure you conserve the original file names as they are called from each other.

As clarification if you want to update a new task that you added , it wont't work and that is because as it uses a fake API it doesn't update a new task that doesn't exist on the API. It is the only case but otherwise than that it works fine.
